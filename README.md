- Given dataset is consists of two survival classes and their data points are highly overlapping making them impossible to distinguish. There seems no way to write accurate if-else statement in order to distinguish them.

- Anyone below 34 years age has always survivied more than 5 years after treatment. Which means younger patients have higher chances to survive more.

- Irrespective of the survival status it appears that women in their menopause are more prone to breast cancer. Since overall IQR of the patients' age appears 41-63 years, and menopause happens to most women in this age range.

- 73.5% patients survived for more than 5 years.

- Nearly 90% of the patients have 10 or less positive auxillary nodes.
